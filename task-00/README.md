## Installing ubuntu

Installing ubuntu was pretty easy , ive dual booted ubuntu alonside windows after partitioning
my ssd and creating a free space.

I downloaded ubuntu from their website . Using rufus , flashed it in my pendrive.
Just restarted with usb plugged in . pressed f12 ,selected usb. Installed ubuntu in the free space i partitioned.

I stopped using windows eventually since ubuntu felt easier for my tasks. Ive done few tasks maybe two or even more on windows.
