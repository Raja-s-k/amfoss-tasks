# Welcome

**FOSS Tasks** are really good and i also like to do those tasks.
Before doing these tasks i know only about python and some stuffs in 
ubuntu , but these tasks taught me about the various branches in cs.
They also helped me to get the tastes in various computer applications.
Sometimes i also struck while doing thesed task. At those times
i had seeked the help of my mentors , friends and our best companion Google. 
The mentors is the foss club are also really helpful to me.

**THANKS TO FOSS**
